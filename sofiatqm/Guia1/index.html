        Now we reached the end
I ran the marathon
The road had many bends
But we knew that all along

I think it made me stronger
But I would rather not
Betray myself just to keep your love
At any cost

And it's most tempting to give in
When you hear the firin' shots
When you're steps from winning back
All the happiness you lost
Lost, lost, lost

With every careless action
You let me slip away
If you just bought me flowers
Maybe I would've stayed

You didn't think I was serious
I guess you felt so safe
If you just bought mе flowers
Maybe I would've stayеd

Maybe I would've stayed
Maybe I would've stayed

The seeds we planted, grew
But not like roses do
We had the thorns and leaves
But the buds they never bloomed
